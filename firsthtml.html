  Tracking Time</h1>
  <p> The theme of 2018 for me is being more self-aware of where my attention is going towards. <br>
It’s incorporating in elements of minimalism, as well as a multitude of self-help books and different podcast sources that I now don’t remember. <br>
I’ve been using an app called Hours, in which I try and track the usage of my time in 5 categories: <br>
</p>
<div>
<h2 class="categories">Extracurriculars</h2>

<h2 class="categories">Health</h2>
<h2 class="categories">Studying</h2>
<h2 class="categories">Assignment Work</h2>
<h2 class="categories">Class</h2>
</div>
<table style="text-align:left; align:center;">
  <tr>
      <th>Week</th>
      <th>Health</th>
      <th>Studying</th>
      <th>Assignment Work</th>
      <th>Class</th>
      <th>Extracurriculars</th>
      <th>Total</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>March 18-24</td>
    <td>1:34</td>
    <td>1:25</td>
    <td>7:18</td>
    <td>8:37</td>
    <td>14:20</td>
    <td>33:13</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>March 25-31</td>
    <td>2:32</td>
    <td>0:44</td>
    <td>27:00</td>
    <td>7:08</td>
    <td>14:39</td>
    <td>52:04</td>
  </tr>

<p>The intended goal is for this to be a way for me to see whether or not I am balancing different aspects of my life well enough or not. Many times, I find that it is extremely easy to be busy, but not really be busy with the things that are truly important.
<br> I like to think of it as a more deliberate lifestyle, where I don’t let what’s in front of me dictate what I spend my time on, but rather what I truly believe are worthwhile pursuits.
